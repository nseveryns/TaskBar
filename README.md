# Status
Currently very basic project in order to teach myself a bit of Swift programming. Currently there's many programming faults and is a very disorganized project. My goals for the project are to move everything into different classes and experiment with different aspects of UI and Swift. 

# Functionality
Currently functionality is very minimum and my goals for it is to save the tasks and have the priority automatically adjusted by an algorithm based on due dates. For example if a project is due in a few hours yet I set a low priority on it, the priority would be increased to a certain amount. The tasks would then be given based on the priority I had set for them. Another future feature I'd like to implement is a task that is recurring and is more of a "When I feel like doing something task".
